SCHEDULE EDT MAKER

This project aims to create and store schedules so as to organize your day.
The built binary generates plain text ``.schl`` files for which each line
represents a task to be done. Each task has a start time, an end time and a
name.

####Usage#####

There are three commands available: start, append and backup

start:
creates a new "today.schl" file and writes a task into it
./edt_maker start <hour_begin> <min_begin> <hour_end> <min_end> <name>

append:
appends a new line (a new task) to the "today.schl" file
./edt_maker append <hour_begin> <min_begin> <hour_end> <min_end> <name>

backup:
copies the "today.schl" file into a new "backup.schl" file. It is not just
a copy of the original file, it reads the original file to make a task_list
and adds writes all the tasks into the new file
./edt_maker backup

####Structures####

The structures used in this project are the following:
- edt_task: represents a task, has a start time, an end time and a name
- edt_task_list: a linked list of tasks with a task and a next field
